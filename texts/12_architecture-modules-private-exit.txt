A group of investors agreed to freeze funds for half a year and invest them in various DeFi protocols. Early exit is possible, but only with a 50% fee on the deposit and no profit. One of the investors needed an early exit, then the DAO manager creates a Private Exit. Investor will see his offer for an early exit on the DAO page and will be able to burn his LP tokens.
