Audits
We care about our contracts security. That is why we are auditing all our smart contracts, including modules. We have NO upgradable proxy and we can not change our contracts' state.
Our audits are available on GitHub:
 - Pessimistic Audit: https://github.com/xdao-app/xdao-contracts/blob/master/audits/pessimistic/pessimistic.pdf
 - Hacken Audit: https://github.com/xdao-app/xdao-contracts/blob/master/audits/hacken/hacken.pdf
