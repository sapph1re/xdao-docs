1) Installing the MetaMask wallet
MetaMask can be installed on your computer, as a browser extensionfor such as Chrome, Opera, or Yandex, or on a mobile device as an Android or iPhone app.
2) Account opening (registration) in MetaMask
After you have installed your MetaMask, you need to open an account. The principle of opening an account on your computer or mobile device is the same.
On the home screen, click the "Get started" button.
If you did not have MetaMask before, click the "Create a new wallet" button.
Agree with the MetaMask rules.
Think of a password for MetaMask. This password will only be used when logging in to the mobile app or browser extension.
The next important step is to save the seed phrase (recovery phrase). The seed phrase is the most important element in the MetaMask wallet. You must never show it to anyone. If someone else has the seed phrase, he will have access to all of your money in the wallet.
Press "View" and write down your seed phrase. It consists of 12 suggested words.
Enter in the suggested window your seed phrase. This will let MetaMask know that you wrote it down and saved it.
Congratulations! You have successfully opened an account with MetaMask.
Your public wallet address is listed on the MetaMask home page.
3) Registration on the exchange
In order to conduct any transactions from your MetaMask wallet, you need to have a coin in your account. A coin is a cryptocurrency that is needed to pay for gas, i.e. a blockchain commission for conducting any transactions. On the Ethereum blockchain, the coin is ETH. The easiest way is to buy ETH on exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, Gate, etc.
The recommended amount to purchase ETH is at least $50. After you purchase ETH, it must be withdrawn to your MetaMask. Choose ETH withdrawal, Ethereum network (ERC20), and enter your public account address, which is listed on the MetaMask homepage.
