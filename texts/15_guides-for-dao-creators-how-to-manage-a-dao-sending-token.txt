Sending Token
On the DAO home page select the "Create Voting" button.
Select any action from the drop-down list. Example: "Send Token". Fill it out. A title will be generated automatically from the inputs, but you may edit it manually. We also recommend including your own explanation of the transaction's purpose in the description field.
To create a vote, sign a message.
Creating and signing a voting in XDAO is entirely free. Payment for a transaction occurs only at the time of activation.
More on hybrid voting.
After creating a voting, you also automatically vote "yes". Other participants will see a new voting with the "In Progress" status. Now they will be able to take part in the voting by signing it in the same way.
After reaching the quorum, the status will be changed to "Ready to activate". Any of the participants can activate voting. It will be charged gas per transaction.
Important! Make sure your wallet network is the same as the DAO network before making any transaction.
The status will be changed to "Activated".
