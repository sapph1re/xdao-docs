Adding new members
Adding a new member to a DAO is basically a simple voting.
Before creating a voting make sure that GT Minting is enabled. Otherwise the transaction will be reverted.
Creating a voting to add a new member can only be possible if GTs Minting is Enabled!
Click to "Add Member" in your DAO page.
To actually add a member type the target address and GT amount.
After the creation and signing the specified number of GTs amount will be Airdroped to the new DAO member and will be shown in the DAO member list.
