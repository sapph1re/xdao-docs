Disabling Private Offer
As mentioned in the previous section, the private transaction is deactivated automatically after use. However, there are times when you need to turn it off manually.
To disable private offer go to "Create voting" in DAO home page.
Fill the form, create and sign it.
After voting private offer will be disabled.
