Sending GTs
Governance tokens or GTs cannot be sent to another wallet via transfer. It was made to avoid voting power manipulation.
Whenever you will try to send Governance token with transfer or transferFrom you will get an error: "GT: transfer is prohibited."
Instead of this, a member can simply move his/her GTs to someone.
In voting section you can find a button called "Create voting" to create a voting for moving your GT tokens to someone.
This option is especially useful if GT Minting on your DAO is disabled and frozen so members can't add another person to the DAO by minting new tokens.
This option is also useful in case GT Burning is disabled and frozen so member can't just leave a DAO by burning tokens.
The form below accept any sender address and checks if a DAO particular member from this DAO has sufficient GT amount.
Otherwise it shows an error "Not enough GT on this wallet."
This function will be executed only if the quorum will be reached.
