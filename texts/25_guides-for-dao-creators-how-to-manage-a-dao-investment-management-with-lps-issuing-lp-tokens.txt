Issuing LP tokens
To accept investments a DAO should issue Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens first of all.
In the DAO home page you see "Offers" section.
Click "Create LP" and you will be transferred to the creation of Voting page.
With this voting, you can simply create a contract for your DAO LP token. LP token is a standard ERC-20 token, 18 decimal.
After the successful execution a DAO will have its own LP.
